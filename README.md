# FastCGI Spec Website

Since fastcgi.com is not available anymore, I ([fbbdev](https://github.com/fbbdev)) created this unofficial website to host the FastCGI Specification.

[Here](https://fast-cgi.github.io) you can find a nicely formatted version of the spec. If you're looking for the original HTML source or a clean markdown version of the spec, you can find them in the [fast-cgi/spec](https://github.com/fast-cgi/spec) repository.
